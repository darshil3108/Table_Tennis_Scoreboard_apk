Table Tennis Scoreboard App (Flutter)
This Flutter-based mobile app is designed to track scores for a table tennis game. Users can customize the number of sets and points required for each set, and add points either through speech recognition or manual input.

Key Features:
Customizable Settings: Set the number of sets and points per set for your game.

Voice Recognition: Add points by saying "Team A" or "Team B" using speech recognition.

Manual Input: Alternatively, users can manually add points for both teams during the game.

Note:
Speech Recognition: Due to the lack of a live server, speech recognition does not work in the mobile APK. The app cannot connect to a server to process voice commands in real-time, which prevents the voice input functionality from working on the mobile version. Users can still manually add points if the speech recognition feature is unavailable
